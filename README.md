# Crowdsourcing

It is a project dedicated to research the class of reinforcement learning algorithms that motivate an agent to learn as many various skills as possible.

Implementation of the following algorithms for learning skills:
1) [VALOR - Variational Option Discovery Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.10299.pdf)(As an algorithm for learning politics - Advantage Actor critic algorithm A2C).
The algorithm was tested on HalfCheetah-v2 and our "Crowdsourcing" environment. 

2) [DIAYN - Diversity is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.06070.pdf)(As an algorithm for learning politics - Soft Actor-Critic SAC).
The algorithm was tested on CartPole-v0 and our "Crowdsourcing" environment. 

Look at the [presentation](https://github.com/AlexandraFilimokhina/Croudsorsing/blob/master/Presentation.pdf)(Russian) to better understand the goals of the project.
